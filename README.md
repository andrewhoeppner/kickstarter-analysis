Analyzing Plays for Louise

Background of Analysist


Louise is trying to fundraise for her play called "Fever". I preformed data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Finding The Useful Data

This presented a challenge because there were several thousand data points. So with the help of excel I filtered it down to find the best way to fundraise for a play. I gathered information about other plays, such as what goals, pledges, outcomes, where those plays took place, how long they fundraised for and what time of year they fundraised.

Results From Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

As you can see by the graph shown above. Fundraising for plays in May is the best time of year to do so to have the most success. While fundraising from January to April as well as June to November does not have as much success, and December being the least amount of chance at a successful fundraiser. So to start a fundraiser in the beginning of May and stop at the end of May would give the best chance of success.

Outcomes Based on Goals

As you can see by the graph shown above. Having a goal from less then $1,000 to $4,999 had the best chance of success. With a goal of $35,000 to $44,999 coming in with the 2nd best chances of having success. While $5,000 to $34,999 and $45,000 to anything over $50,000 did not have much success at all. In conclusion it would be best to have a fundraising goal of no more then $5,000.

Potential Limitations of the Data


The data used only dates back to 2009, we could get a larger dataset and a more accurate analysist the more data we have. Although we do know what country the plays were fundraised for, we do not know what city they were fundraised in. Knowing the city could be useful because of population, the more people, the more potential donations. 

Recommendations on Additional Tables or Graphs

It would be nice to know what the money that was fundraised was spent on, such as cast, materials, venue, and so forth to compare that with who was successful and where they spent most of their money. We also could have made a table showing the amount of backers compared to how successful a play was.
